#  Genetic Algorithm for Network Optimization

Optimization of traffic flow in a road network using **MATLABâ€™s Genetic Algorithm**, applied to a nonlinear objective function with flow conservation and capacity constraints.

Developed as part of the course **Optimization Techniques** at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

##  Problem Overview

A traffic network with **9 intersections (nodes)** and **17 roads (edges)** is modeled. Each road has a specific capacity and a congestion-sensitive travel time. The objective is to **minimize the total travel time per vehicle** by distributing traffic optimally, while satisfying:

- **Flow conservation** at all internal nodes  
- **Inflow = outflow** condition  
- **Per-road capacity limits**

Red numbers indicate road capacity \( c_i \) (vehicles/min). Each arrow represents a one-way traffic path between intersections.

##  Travel Time Function

The delay for road \(i\) is modeled by the nonlinear function:

![Ti(xi)](images/Ti(xi).png)

Where:
- \( t_i \): base (uncongested) travel time  
- \( a_i \): congestion factor  
- \( x_i \): flow on road \(i\)  
- \( c_i \): road capacity  

The total network cost is:

f(x) = âˆ‘áµ¢ xáµ¢ Â· Táµ¢(xáµ¢)

##  Methodology

We solve the nonlinear constrained optimization problem using MATLABâ€™s built-in **Genetic Algorithm (`ga`)**. This choice is robust to local minima and does not require gradient information.

###  Constraints
- Linear equality constraints: **Aâ‚‘q Â· x = bâ‚‘q**
- Bound constraints: **0Â â‰¤Â xáµ¢Â â‰¤Â cáµ¢**
- Flow conservation is built into `Aeq`, `beq`

##  Experiments

###  Baseline Optimization
- **File:** `optimize_flow_baseline.m`
- **Traffic inflow:** \( V = 100 \) vehicles/min

###  Robustness Analysis
- **File:** `optimize_flow_variable_V.m`
- **Tested inflows:** \( V = 85, 95, 105, 115 \)
- For each V, the GA is run and convergence plots are generated.
